            Dear Prime Minister,<br>
            &nbsp; Some weeks ago you paid us the honour of a visit, and we believe that you <br>
            regard our work as important. You will have seen that, thanks largely to the
            energy and foresight of Commander Travis, we have been well supplied with the
            ‘bombes’ for the breaking of the German Enigma codes. We think, however, that
            you ought to know that this work is being held up, and in some cases is not being
            done at all, principally because we cannot get suYcient staV to deal with it. Our
            reason for writing to you direct is that for months we have done everything that
            we possibly can through the normal channels, and that we despair of any early
            improvement without your intervention. No doubt in the long run these particular requirements will be met, but meanwhile still more precious months will
            have been wasted, and as our needs are continually expanding we see little hope
            of ever being adequately staVed. <br>
            &nbsp; We realise that there is a tremendous demand for labour of all kinds and that <br>
            its allocation is a matter of priorities. The trouble to our mind is that as we are a
            very small section with numerically trivial requirements it is very diYcult to
            bring home to the authorities Wnally responsible either the importance of what is
            done here or the urgent necessity of dealing promptly with our requests. At the
            same time we Wnd it hard to believe that it is really impossible to produce quickly
            the additional staV that we need, even if this meant interfering with the normal
            machinery of allocations. <br>
            &nbsp; We do not wish to burden you with a detailed list of our diYculties, but the
            following are the bottlenecks which are causing us the most acute anxiety <br>
        
          <br> <span class="span"> 1. Breaking of Naval Enigma (Hut 8)</span>
        <article>
            Owing to shortage of staV and the overworking of his present team the Hollerith
            section here under Mr Freeborn has had to stop working night shifts. The eVect
            of this is that the Wnding of the naval keys is being delayed at least twelve hours
            every day. In order to enable him to start night shifts again Freeborn needs
            immediately about twenty more untrained Grade III women clerks. To put
            himself in a really adequate position to deal with any likely demands he will
            want a good many more. <br>

            A further serious danger now threatening us is that some of the skilled male
            staV, both with the British Tabulating Company at Letchworth and in Freeborn’s
            section here, <br>

            Middle East which cannot be picked up by our intercepting stations here. This
            contains among other things a good deal of new ‘Light Blue’ intelligence. Owing

        <span class="span"> &nbsp; 3. Bombe testing, Hut 6 and Hut 8 </span> 
        <article>
            In July we were promised that the testing of the ‘stories’ produced by the bombes
            would be taken over by the WRNS in the bombe hut and that suYcient WRNS
            would be provided for this purpose. It is now late in October and nothing
            has been done. We do not wish to stress this so strongly as the two preceding
            points, because it has not actually delayed us in delivering the goods. It has,
            however, meant that staV in Huts 6 and 8 who are needed for other jobs have
            had to do the testing themselves. We cannot help feeling that with a Service
            matter of this kind it should have been possible to detail a body of WRNS for
            this purpose, if suYciently urgent instructions had been sent to the right
            quarters. <br>

              <br> <strong>4.</strong>  &nbsp; Apart altogether from staV matters, there are a number of other directions
            in which it seems to us that we have met with unnecessary impediments. It
            would take too long to set these out in full, and we realise that some of the
            matters involved are controversial. The cumulative eVect, however, has been to
            drive us to the conviction that the importance of the work is not being impressed 
             with suYcient force upon those outside authorities  with whom we have to
            deal. <br>
            &nbsp; We have written this letter entirely on our own initiative. We do not know
            who or what is responsible for our diYculties, and most emphatically we do
            not want to be taken as criticising Commander Travis who has all along done
            his utmost to help us in every possible way. But if we are to do our job as well
            as it could and should be done it is absolutely vital that our wants, small as they
            are, should be promptly attended to. We have felt that we should be failing in
